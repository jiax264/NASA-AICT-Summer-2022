ICT Testing Baseline Guide/Form (format for test results)

 * Phase 2,3 need buy-in from SEWP
 
 * Rio provides process, I provide format to report test results
 
 * 

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Rationale

  * No knowledge of a standardized flow for ICT testing
  
  * Certain tests are more subjective than others
  
  * Testers and test viewers alike would benefit from structured, more evidence-based testing

Objectives

  * PHASE ONE: Create a form for user to fill out during testing
  
    - Contains guiding questions to help user understand the objective of each test
    
    - Provides space for testers to enter the HTML/CSS/JavaScript that passes/fails the test
    
    - Provides space for testers to justify their pass/fail verdict on the test
    
    - Curates test into a single, retrievable form submission
    
  * PHASE TWO (TIME PERMITTING): Create repository/database of previous tests
  
    - Based on the assumption that previous tests are useful to access
    
    - Stores tester info, test date, website tested, and test (form) 
    
    - Test results are stored as separate fields in the database entry OR as an HTML file (TBD)
    
      --> If the test is an HTML file, write program to convert test into an accessible HTML file
      
  * PHASE THREE (TIME PERMITTING): Create way to publicly access test repository/database
   
    - Could be a website, SQLite file, or other way to retrieve previous tests

Tasks

  PHASE ONE

    * Personally test more websites (potentially with or with direction from advisor)

      - Get more experience testing websites and encountering different problems and situations

      - Note common questions I ask myself or common misconceptions I have with the test objectives

      - Get practice recognizing HTML/CSS/JavaScript responsible for content being tested

    * Come up with guiding questions for each baseline test

      - Based on common questions and misconceptions above

      - Guiding questions outline the flowchart path of the form

    * Choose an authoring tool to make the form

      - Google Form? Other form making services? Adobe Acrobat?

    * Create the ICT Testing Baseline Form based off the guiding questions

      - Provide text input for HTML/CSS/JavaScript code and pass/fail rationale

      - Provide radio input for pass/fail
      
      - Ask for the user's information, test date, and web page tested

  PHASE TWO (TIME PERMITTING):
  
    * Find way to export/store form submissions in some file
    
    * (OPTIONAL) Create program to turn form submission into HTML file
    
      - Takes in form submissions as input, outputs HTML file for browser viewing
      
    * Create database/repository for storing HTML files/form submissions
    
      - Could be SQL, MongoDB, Redis, or other database services
      
  PHASE THREE (TIME PERMITTING):
  
    * Create website backed by test database
    
      - Based on school knowledge (Using Flask to create a database-backed website)
      
  
Deliverables

  * PHASE ONE: Form/Guide/Flowchart for ICT Baseline Testing
  
  * PHASE TWO (TIME PERMITTING): Database for storing ICT Baseline tests
  
  * PHASE THREE (TIME PERMITTING): Website/public method to retrieve ICT Baseline tests
  
Resources Required

  * Access to form authoring tools
  
    - Adobe Acrobat (if making the form here is the best option)
    
    - Talk to SEWP, they'll have options
    
     --> SharePoint?
     
  * Database service

    - Downloadable for free on any laptop
    
        --> SharePoint?
    
  * I have everything I need for this project

Timeline

  * 2 weeks to create form
  
    - 1 week to perform sample tests and formulate guiding questions
    
    - 1 week to create and test form
 
 * PHASE TWO AND THREE: TBD
 
  - Depends on the scope of integration with Rio's part
  
  * 1 week buffer/preparation for final presentation

Report on Automated Accessibility Checkers

Rationale

 * Accessibility checkers will catch and miss certain things
 
 * Important to know/measure how "useful" accessibility checkers are

Objectives

  * Gain access to several automated accessibility checkers
  
  * Design an experiment and methodology to assess these checkers
  
  * Select testing websites and create quantitative/qualitative method to assess checkers
  
  * Produce a report on my findings
  
Tasks

  * Gain access to several automated accessibility checkers
  
  * Design an experiment and methodology to assess these checkers
  
  * Select testing websites and create quantitative/qualitative method to assess checkers
  
  * Produce a report on my findings
  
Deliverables

  * Written report or presentation on my findings

Resources Required 

  * Access to several automated accessibility checkers
  
   - Could cost money or require free trials
   
  * I have everything I need to do this task

Timeline

  * Could happen in addition to the ICT Testing Baseline Form, or instead of it

  * 2 weeks to set up the experiment
  
   - Get access to automated accessibility checkers
   
   - Formulate hypothesis (?) and methodology
   
   - Choose websites to test
   
   - Set up experiment
   
  * 1 week to test checkers
  
   - Use checkers on websites
   
   - Collect data
   
  * 1 week to report and present 
  
   - Analyze data and draw conclusions
   
   - Draft and finalize report
