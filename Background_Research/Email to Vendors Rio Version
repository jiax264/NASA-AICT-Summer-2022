Dear Company,

I hope this message finds you well. My partner, Owen Chong, and I, Rio Jia, are summer interns at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, Maryland. For our project, we are producing a performance assessment on several web accessibility checkers, and we would like to request a 30-day fully functioning trial of [your product]. Our final report will be distributed government-wide, and NASA will use it to purchase a new accessibility checker software in 3 months. Please let us know if you are interested in this opportunity. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
Rio Jia (xueyuan.jia@nasa.gov, xueyuan.jia@vanderbilt.edu) 
Owen Chong (owen.s.chong@nasa.gov, ochong@mail.umw.edu)
