Features

  * They're providing software? I thought it was cloud-based, I'm confused

  * Can manage users
  
  * Can create projects to work on certain sites
  
    - green number = number of sites, red number = number of failed sites
    
        --> green is total number of sites, don't add numbers together!
  
  * Can make reports be monthly (good feature for NASA)
  
  * Can choose certain sites/files to not include in the report
  
  * Error layout is smushed and not the most user friendly
  
      - There's a LOT of information
      
      - Can't edit errors via Little Forest
      
        --> However, they've got some other platform to edit errors onsite (in progress)
  
  * Can ignore errors to allow users to focus on other errors
  
  * Everything takes quite a bit of time to load
  
    - Running tests can time out, that would be very frustrating
    
  * They got a VPAT and automated ACR
