* They called Antonio and Betsy Antony and Betty respectfully, lmao

Features

  * They're providing software? I thought it was cloud-based, I'm confused
    * I think it's just a site we go on that runs our stuff on the cloud. 
  
  * When starting go straight to accessibility report and then overview later 
  * according to Gavin, errors are obvious breaches of a guideline and are generally not false positives 
      while warnings indicate potential issue that requires manual checking <-- good that it assists with manual checking 
      
  * can run all pages and can adjust settings to log on and get behind authentication protected sites 
  * can also run using mobile device <-- do they mean you can use their checker on a mobile device or that it can check accessibility for a mobile device? 
  * Can manage users
  
  * Can create projects to work on certain sites
  
    - green number = number of sites, red number = number of failed sites
    
        --> green is total number of sites, don't add numbers together!
  
  * Can make reports be monthly (good feature for NASA)
  
  * Can choose certain sites/files to not include in the report
  
  * Error layout is smushed and not the most user friendly
  
      - There's a LOT of information
      
      - Can't edit errors via Little Forest
      
        --> However, they've got some other platform to edit errors onsite (in progress)
  
  * Can ignore errors to allow users to focus on other errors, ignored error will appear in ignored rules section and can be unignored again 
  
  * dashboard does give a score but it may be over enthusiastic b/c just based on automated testing and might be more issues 
      - like you can score 100 by fixing all issues detected by automated checker but still may be issues that require manual testing 
  
  * Everything takes quite a bit of time to load
  
    - Running tests can time out, that would be very frustrating <-- this also happens on SortSite
    
  * They could get a VPAT and automated ACR
  
  * Domain discovery big thing they have 
    - can run lighthouse accessibility report which sends browser to those sites and then populates accessibility scores 
    - running tab, general view 
    
  * If have a piece of code we know definitely has an error, can do a search on that which will show all places across the site where that piece of code is used 
     - ^ this is nice, i like that 
     
  * A blind user at Harvard is currently testing their platform for accessibility 
  
  
Overview

  * Can see some scores and host of errors
  
    - EX: images are flagged for size (affects loading of page) and alt text, the one they showed us was just for size, 
         it actually had alt text but Gavin and Billy said it didn't 
  
  
Accessibility Reports
  
  * Can toggle between section 508 Score (2.0), A Score (2.1), AA Score (2.1), and AAA Score (2.1)
    * for NASA they can set our default setting to 508 (for WCAG 2.0)
  
  * Can export report into a CSV file
  
  * Can add/delete/run multiple pages
  
  * Can run individual page reports in real time <-- I like this -Rio
    - once you fix a page, can rerun the test and see if you introduced new areas or successfully fixed the errors 
  * can assign people to review certain errors 
  
  * can track scores overtime 

  * Shows notices (green), warning (yellow), and errors (red)
  
      - Click on number and see WCAG violations + links to W3C website
      
      - Occurences are in small number below

  * Shows errors in HTML code

  * Can set up credentials to bypass authentication
  
  * Can see contrast changes in real time
  
      - Recommends color changes for contrast ratio, but doesn't account for design (obviously)
      
  * Shows links without text or indescriptive text (links should have title or alt text)
  
  * NASA About heading on the nav bar is unclear (picked up by the checker)
    - should have text that can be read by a screen reader that's more clear than about (don't have to change display of 'about' to non screen reader user)
    
  * checker picked up that search bar form placeholder not good, better to use a label so AT can read it 
  
  * Screen Reader Wand = hover over any content and see what a screen reader would read
  
  * Shows ARIA landmarks 
  
      - Content without ARIA Landmarks won't show up as errors
      - aria landmarks act as a map so instea do of scroll w a mouse, navigate w aria landmarks like here is search box, main content, an image, etc. so can get
        where you want right away 
  
  * Technical View shows backend errors, Inspect View shows frontend errors
    * inspect view flags unfortunately not tab accessible <-- tool not completely accessible rip 
  
Pricing

  * https://littleforest.co.uk/pricing/
  
  * Doesn't limit concurrent users
  
  * Enterprise package doesn't limit number of pages- ($14,400)
  
    - Annual or multi-year pricing
  
    - Having Little Forest fix errors themselves (manual testing) costs extra (we probably won't need this) (this is charged by time and materials) 
    
      --> Unlimited pages and domains 
      
    - includes accessibility training for company like how to write alt text, etc. get culture of accessibility and message out
    
  * can definitely get a scaled down pricing if only want the service for certain domains (no limit on number of pages) 
    this would prob be half cost of enterprise solution
