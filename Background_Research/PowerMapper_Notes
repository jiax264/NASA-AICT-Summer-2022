* There's some sort of effort to standardize what errors WACs catch, spearheaded by the EU

* Some UK group used 10-12 checkers on gov.uk (look for this report?)

* Relationship between coverage and false positive

  - The more you cover, the higher chance of a false positive
  


What's Unique

* Evidence-based a11y testing = repository of tests of solutions

  - Affects which things are flagged/covered

  - Shows impact of error on screen reader and browser
  
  - Helps wiyh a11y compatibility (could conform but doesn't work in browser or AT)

* Simulate CSS engines

* Can spider

  * Can scan SharePoint
  
    - SharePoint URLs are almost identical except for hexadecimal at end of URL
