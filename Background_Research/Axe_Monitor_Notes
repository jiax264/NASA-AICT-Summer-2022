worldspace is old name for axe monitor


other tools that they offer use automated accessibility scan feature at component level or web page level for a scan 
* some provide some assistance w manual testing
* axe auditor intended for accessibility subject matter experts to perform all manual testing


axe monitor: automated testing across web application


can set up multiple projects


when examine scan for particular financial institution
can configure scan and include url of that scan
pass in some reference to particular domain put under test and then set depth of that scan


also ability to schedule scans to run periodically
* could change scheduling
once have scan occuring on particular project have ability to identify high level insights about accessibility on entire application
* high level insights: provide organization w operational intelligence
* what is the state of an applicationâ€™s digital accessibility and where has that state been? what is context for what that state is


for example can gain some insights: i have scanned 112 pages of application, of those pages, 20 had at least one critical issue
issue breakdown by severity add to score for particular axe monitor project
operational intelligence about what is state of my digital accessibility
allow u to drill down on pages and issues to get to specific accessibility violations on these pages


take this data and display it w other projects


axe reports dashboard which is part of axe monitor
* can wrap all of scan data into particular tags under particular umbrella
* able to wrap all financial projects under fin tag and compare all projects under that banner to rest of my projects
* compare accessibility score to every other project in my system


identification of issues by category, by severity etc


give source code where particular violation happening
some remediation information
remediation info is in addition to relevant deque university links
identify specific violation also provide users w even more info and education to understand issue and remediate 
understand more about why particular issue matters




display info about comments of issue 
* saved at that issue

Owen thinks Axe Monitor has a focus on data visualization 


scripts powerful feature but might be overly technical for people trying to test nasa pages
