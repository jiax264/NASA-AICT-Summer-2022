Silktide Meeting Notes

SilkTide is a cloud-based tool, David unsure if they have worked with federal agencies before but they have gotten around firewalls and have worked with governmental organizations 

cannot export their data

support pdf and mobile accessibility testing

recognizes that automated testing cannot pick up everything and their tool guides the user through how to manual test: suggests that manual testing be done by individuals with disabilities

recommends reducing pdfs on sites and converting them to html

the tool also has a task management system that can set tasks for people to fix certain accessibility issues

tool has a dashboard area that shows statistics and which user is fixing what

there is no restriction on the number of users using the tool at one time and is not charged by user

Silktide works by monitoring. For example, restesting a site every 5 days and noting the issues. 

Conâ€”it will rescan sites that have not changed between reviews

Charges by the number of pages monitored 

additional ad-ons include what modules you subscribe to

Dashboard with all the different sites being monitored that can encourage competition to have the most accessible site between different departments 

Antonio suggests Rio and Owen to look into the pros and cons of monitoring versus auditing sites for accessibility 

David will follow up with some availability for to give us a demo sometime next week; after that will provide 30 day free trial

Intro to Silktide
    * motto is "make the web a beter place"
      * inclusive digital experience for everyone 
    * main purpose is to make large websites better 
    * work with ebay, disney, scope, world health organization, santander, accenture, university of oxford, texas tech, honeywell, etc. 
    * about people, not just legislation

    * will highlight the issue directly on the page and inform you how to fix it 
    * in depth explanations and tailored support videos that are produced in house by silktide 
    * dashboard that provides visibility and reporting on how all your sites are performing 
    * idea behind consistently and periodically testing sites in intervals is that websites change a lot and want to catch issues as they're happening 
      * ability to customize dashboard 
    * main goal is to decomplexify complexities of section 508 compliance and WCAG guidelines 
    * shows the impact an issue has on the end user, provides detailed explanation on why the 
      issue is a problem and makes recommendations on how to fix it and then allows you to retest the site

    * charges based on number of pages, but can do unlimited testing/retesting 
    
    * Best used for consistent testing on a certain group of webpages
    
    * Tests mobile accessibility to comply with WCAG 2.1
    
    * Runs on AWS cloud, servers hosted in NOVA
    
    * Look for silktide blog post on headless browsers!
      * A lot of the other commercial web accessbility checkers just test the underlying source code 
         * sure, they can detect whether you have written alt text for an image or whether there's text for a link but silktide can test more than that 
      * Silktide fully renders each page and uses headless browsers to evaluate websites. By doing so, it sees more than a traditional website scan can.
         * can detect if keyboard navigation is working correctly, any issues on mobile
      * Silktide sees the final finished version of the page ***key thing that separates silktide from its competitors 
         * sees the pages with all the javascript and visual cues loaded, sees very closely to what end user sees 
         * this feature is what sold the World Health Organization on getting silktide
