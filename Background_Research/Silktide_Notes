Silktide Meeting Notes

SilkTide is a cloud-based tool, David unsure if they have worked with federal agencies before but they have gotten around firewalls and have worked with governmental organizations 

cannot export their data

support pdf and mobile accessibility testing

recognizes that automated testing cannot pick up everything and their tool guides the user through how to manual test: suggests that manual testing be done by individuals with disabilities

recommends reducing pdfs on sites and converting them to html

the tool also has a task management system that can set tasks for people to fix certain accessibility issues

tool has a dashboard area that shows statistics and which user is fixing what

there is no restriction on the number of users using the tool at one time and is not charged by user

Silktide works by monitoring. For example, restesting a site every 5 days and noting the issues. 

Conâ€”it will rescan sites that have not changed between reviews

Charges by the number of pages monitored 

additional ad-ons include what modules you subscribe to

Dashboard with all the different sites being monitored that can encourage competition to have the most accessible site between different departments 

Antonio suggests Rio and Owen to look into the pros and cons of monitoring versus auditing sites for accessibility 

David will follow up with some availability for to give us a demo sometime next week; after that will provide 30 day free trial
