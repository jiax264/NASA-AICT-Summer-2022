[Insert company name],

I hope this emails finds you well. My partner, Rio Jia, and I, Owen Chong, are summer interns at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, Maryland. 

We have been learning about IT accessibility, Section 508, and WCAG 2.0 for the past few weeks as part of our internship. 

For our project, we are producing a performance assessment on several web accessibility checkers. 

We've identified your product as a potential subject for our report, and we'd like to request a 30-day fully functioning trial of your product.

The report will be submitted to NASA at-large and may become the primary product that NASA purchases to implement web accessibility.

Please let us know if you are interested in this opportunity. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Owen Chong (owen.s.chong@nasa.gov, oschong2@gmail.com)
