[Insert company name],

I hope this emails finds you well. I'm Owen Chong, a summer intern at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, Maryland. 

I've been learning about IT accessibility, Section 508, and WCAG 2.0 for the past few weeks as part of my internship. 

As interns, we are required to do a project related to our internship; as such, my fellow intern Rio Jia and I are producing a performance assessment on several web accessibility checkers. 

We've identified your product as a potential subject for our report, and we'd like to request a demo of your product.

The report will be submitted to NASA at-large and may become the primary product NASA uses for web accessibility.

Please let us know if you have any questions. We look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Owen Chong  [NASA email and personal email]
