[insert company name],

I hope this email finds you well. My colleague, Rio Jia, and I, Owen Chong, are summer interns at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, Maryland. 

Our internship pertains to IT accessibility, Section 508, and WCAG 2.0 conformance. 

We're producing a performance assessment on several web accessibility checkers. As such, we'd like to request a 30-day fully functioning trial of [insert product name].

Please let us know if you are interested in this opportunity. We look forward to hearing from you soon.


Sincerely,

Owen Chong (owen.s.chong@nasa.gov, ochong@mail.umw.edu)
