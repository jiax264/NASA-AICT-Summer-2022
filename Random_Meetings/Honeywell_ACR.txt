These are my notes from the review of Honeywell toxic gas detection ACR

They're testing the visualization software used to identify toxic gas

If something doesn't apply with 508, make sure to say "N/A" instead of "Supports"

1.3.1 - Info and Relationships

    * Software was created in WindowsXP, so ARIA is not applicable

    * Does not support ARIA but relationships are tagged and JAWS reads it fine
    
        - ARIA can't be used in software
        
        - Partially supported?
    
    * AccessibilityInsights shows relationships in software
