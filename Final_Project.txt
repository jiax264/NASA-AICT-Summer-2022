Report on Automated Accessibility Checkers

PUT RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES HERE

Next Steps

  * Break down tasks/timeline in-depth (dates and names)
  
    - Get READY for presentation to Betsy
  
  * Research and get access to checkers
  
    - Look at ComplianceSheriff and Andi (used for Trusted Tester)
    
  * Work on report outline (put in GitHub)

Rationale

 * Accessibility checkers will catch and miss certain things
 
 * Important to know/measure how "useful" accessibility checkers are

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Objectives

  * Produce report for NASA to potentially replace SortSite

Considerations

  * Security --> desktop > cloud
    
    - EX: Check if Deque is cloud-based
    
    - Cloud-based may need access to internal NASA servers, potential security issue
    
  * Check effectiveness with responsive websites
  
  * Narrow down to automated *web* checkers (

Timeline - 5 weeks total

  Questions
  
    * How many checkers and websites do we choose? Which websites?
      
      - How to deal with inconsistencies and other checker variables?
      
    * How to deal with two variables: Different checkers and different websites?
    
    * What did the previous reports conclude? What was their methodology?
 
  Timeless Tasks
  
    * Manual web checking (ICT Baseline Testing)
    
    * Make final report accessible
    
    * ICT Baseline Example videos (time permitting)
    
    * Practice with acessibility checkers

  Background Research - 1 week, joint effort
  
    * Look up how checkers work
    
    * Request/Get access to checkers (out of our control)
    
      - Overcompensate!
     
      - SortSite (yes!), WAVE, Accessibility Insights, SiteImprove, Deque Axe, etc?
      
      - Allot time for ESD to install software
      
  * Consider only "spidering" checkers, as opposed to "page-by-page" checkers
  
    - WAVE, Accessibility Insights = page-by-page
    
    - Spidering tools = SortSite, SiteImprove
    
  * Selenium/Axe = open-source spidering tool
    
   * Look at previous reports
    
    
  Evaluation Setup - 2 weeks 
  
    * Get access to automated web accessibility checkers
    
      - See "Request/Get access to checkers" above
   
    * Brainstorm research question(s)
   
      - "How helpful is the checker towards manual testing?"
     
      - "How do these checkers work? Are there certain scenarios where 1 > other?"
   
    * Choose websites to test
   
      - NASA.gov, SEWP
     
      - Control website is a good one/one that's easily manually testable: Section 508
         
    * Set up performance evaluation
   
      - Create outline for final report
     
      - Looking for:
     
         1) Usability of checker
         
         2) Functionality of checker
         
         3) Amount of error coverage
         
         4) Types of errors found
         
       - Quantitative/qualitative way to present findings
   
  Performance Evaluation - 1 week
  
   * Use checkers on websites
   
   * Collect data
   
     - See "Set up performance evaluation" above
   
  Analysis and Conclusion - 1 week
  
    * Analyze data
    
    * Write final report
