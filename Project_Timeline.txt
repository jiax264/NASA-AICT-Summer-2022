Report on Automated Accessibility Checkers

Rationale

 * Accessibility checkers will catch and miss certain things
 
 * Important to know/measure how "useful" accessibility checkers are

Objectives

  * Gain access to several automated accessibility checkers
  
  * Design an experiment and methodology to assess these checkers
  
  * Select testing websites and create quantitative/qualitative method to assess checkers
  
  * Produce a report on my findings
  
Tasks

  * Gain access to several automated accessibility checkers
  
  * Design an experiment and methodology to assess these checkers
  
  * Select testing websites and create quantitative/qualitative method to assess checkers
  
  * Produce a report on my findings
  
Deliverables

  * Written report or presentation on my findings
  
  * Consumer/executive report with pros, cons, etc

Resources Required 

  * Access to several automated accessibility checkers
  
   - Could cost money or require free trials
   
  * I have everything I need to do this task

Timeline

  * 1 week to do research!!!
  
    --> Look at previous reports
    
    --> Look up how checkers work

  * 2 weeks to set up the experiment
  
   - Get access to automated web accessibility checkers
   
     --> Select (up to 5) accessibility checkers
     
        --> Include SortSite, since this is the current checker used by govt
        
        --> WAVE, Accessibility Insights, SiteImprove, Deque Axe, 
   
   - Formulate hypothesis (?) and methodology
   
     --> "How helpful is the checker towards manual testing?"
     
     --> "How do these checkers work? Are there certain scenarios where 1 > other?"
   
   - Choose websites to test
   
     --> NASA.gov, SEWP
     
     --> Control website is a good one/one that's easily manually testable: Section 508
   
   - Set up experiment
   
     --> Create outline for final report
     
     --> Looking for:
     
         1) Usability of checker
         
         2) Functionality of checker
         
         3) Amount of error coverage
         
         4) Types of errors found
         
      --> Quantitative/qualitative way to present findings
   
  * 1 week to test checkers
  
   - Use checkers on websites
   
   - Collect data
   
  * 1 week to report and present 
  
   - Analyze data and draw conclusions
   
   - Draft and finalize report
