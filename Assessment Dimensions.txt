Must-haves:
* Tests against Section 508 and WCAG 2.0 standards
* Spidering capability


Assessment Dimensions:
report quality
* results consistency
   * for the same page, should always catch the same issues if the page hasn’t changed
* results accuracy 
   * rate of false positives & false negatives: liberal or conservative leaning?
* types of issues caught 
   * impact of issue caught: is it something a human could easily detect while manually testing or is it something that would be difficult for a human to detect? With the automated checker catching this kind of issue, how much time is saved? 
* testing the browser DOM? 


further suggestions/feedback
* guidance on manual testing process
   * is tool explicit about which standards require manual testing and how to do so?
* guidance on how to fix detected issues 
   * rooted in the official documentation from section 508/WCAG 2.0?
   * does it link to helpful pages? 
   * if auto-suggestions are provided, are these reflective of good practice? 

in app vs export
* report export
  * What formats are available for export for sharing results with developers and others?
  * does exported report contain all the information provided in the in-app experience? 
  * how easy is it to navigate the UI of the exported report? 


report efficiency
* speed of spidering and report generation 


UI
* accessibility/508 compliance of tool itself 
* complexity of installation, set up, and use 
   * is interface intuitive?
* readability of documentation
* readability/clarity of report
   * repetitive vs concise reporting
      * if a site uses a template for each page, tool only reports the issues once instead of doing so for every page that uses that template 


Monitoring vs By-need Auditing 
* if works by monitoring, can we customize the frequency and does it only test pages that have changed since the last test to improve efficiency


Additional Capabilities
* ability to perform scheduled monitoring 
   * only tests pages that have changed since the last test to improve efficiency 
* ability to test internal or password protected sites 
* ability to control link depth for spidering 
* ability to test form actions?
* ability to test on local html and unpublished sites? 
* what other settings/configurations does it offer?


Work for the vendor
* if tool is cloud based service, FedRAMP certified? If not, must go through that process.


Cost / Licensing 
* annual subscription or by use volume, etc.
