Video Shorts on ICT Baseline Tests 

Rationale
* Currently, there aren’t video examples demonstrating the ICT baseline tests 
   * For a beginner wanting to learn how to perform the tests, might be helpful to have reference videos to see examples in action
* Accessible programming isn’t built into the curriculum for many web design courses 
   * not only would I benefit from learning how to do some basic accessible web programming, I can also share what I learn with others who are also new to it

Objectives
* For each baseline test, create short videos of conforming and non-conforming examples 
* Testing / UI example videos
   * Conforming
      * walk through how to test a conforming example from a real site 
   * Non-Conforming
      * walk through how to test a non-conforming example from a real site and why it fails 
         * create own non-conforming example if can’t find one from a real site
         * examples of most common failures (from WCAG) 
* Behind the scenes videos 
   * Conforming
      * show how to code with accessibility in mind from the design/start
         * show some very easy/beginner friendly techniques 
   * Non-Conforming
      * copy html from a non-conforming site then live code how to fix 
         * if can’t find example, create own and show how to fix 

Tasks
* For each baseline test
   * review the standard, WCAG requirement, techniques, & examples
   * find example(s) from website(s) 
   * figure out how to illustrate that isolated feature 
   * prepare materials & write preliminary script for video 
* Synthesize, revise, & edit after all baseline test drafts complete
* record & upload to YouTube

Deliverables
* YouTube Playlist 

Resources Required 
* YouTube + caption editor in YouTube 
* Screen Recorder like OBS Studio 
* text editor or IDE 

Timeline
* 3-4 weeks to prepare drafts for each baseline test 
   * 1 day for tests 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 21
   * ½ day for tests 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24
   * negligible/any day with extra time for tests 11, 15, 19 
* 1 week to record (5 tests/day) 
* 1 week buffer/preparation for final presentation 


Slidedoc Accessibility

Rationale
* Although a bit niche, is a format where accessibility really is essential because it’s designed to be read and digested alone without a presenter 
* A useful and impactful way to convey important information
* Used by industry and education 
* Would bring this back to my institution 

Objectives
* determine and collect which standards apply from authoring tools and WCAG, probably a lot of overlap with Powerpoint accessibility 
* tailor things to focus on to slidedocs specifically 

Tasks
* research slidedocs
* research powerpoint accessibility 
* find accessibility pain points for slidedocs 

Deliverables
* a video on how to create and design an accessible slidedoc from the start 
* an accessible slidedoc on creating accessible slidedocs 

Resources Required 
* Microsoft Powerpoint

Timeline
* 1 week: 3 days for research & 2 days for deliverables
